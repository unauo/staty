# Staty

Staty is an internship project for JotForm. It is a tool for users to see statistics of their payment forms, in the comfort of their beloved browsers. 

## using Node.js and npm

If you have Node.js and npm installed, you can try Staty out on your own system. First, be sure that you have a JotForm account and at least one form with a payment field. Clone the repo, navigate to `staty` folder and run `npm install`. When the installation is complete, run `node app.js` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
